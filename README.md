# Auto-Setups
A small easy and simple script to help you quickly hit the road of python development

# Usage
The Execution of the script is something like this, depends on the system that you're using
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruyyi0323/Auto-Setups/master/ubuntu_1804_ec2_setup.sh)"
```

For Example, If you are creating an instance on AWS whose AMI is Ubuntu 18.04, you can do the following (actually this script should be working for a general Ubuntu instance who has curl and wget)
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ruyyi0323/Auto-Setups/master/ubuntu_1804_ec2_setup.sh)"
```
